Checkpoint A:
Describe your design for your site's shopping cart. That is, will it be a separate page that the user can view and edit, or will it be integrated into the product pages? If so, describe in detail how this will work on your site. Provide several examples of using the cart.

The design of my shopping cart will be a separate page that the user can view and edit. Similar to other sites there will be a shopping cart icon in the top right corner where it leads to the cart page. An example of how it would work is the user would put have the item go into the shopping cart, there they can edit the amount if needed and then they will be able to checkout which leads to them to a page where they can put in their information to purchase the products (similar to my invoice). 

Checkpoint B:
Explain specifically how you will use sessions to manage your shopping cart. In particular, what shopping cart data will be stored in the session, what data format will be used (NOT what data type, but the format like with the data format used for your registration data). Use code examples showing what data structures (such as arrays and their keys) you will use to manage the shopping cart data and how they will beused in $_SESSION.

I am still figuring out this part out, I'm hoping after we finish Lab 15 I can get a better understanding of how to use sessions and be able to use it in Assignment 3.

Checkpoint C:
How will you avoid access to your application when the user has not logged in or registered? What are the particular security concerns you must address?

Similar to my invoice page if the user isn't logged in it'll redirect to the login page.

Checkpoint D:
Upon a successful login, how do you provide personalization in your UI? Explain how you did or will do this (paste code if necessary)

I will provide personalization in my UI similar to my invoice with code that gets the username which uses it as a variable and then I'll plug it into a message that says Aloha "username"!, something along the lines of that.

Checkpoint E:
If you are working with partners, how will you split up the work in your team so that you are working in parallel as effectively as possible? That is, who is doing what and when?

I will not be working with a partner.

Checkpoint F:
How are you approaching Assignment 3 differently than Assignment 2?
I am approaching Assignment 3 differently than Assignment 2 by not inserting random code but instead get an understanding of what I'm doing and putting in proper code.
