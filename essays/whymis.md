Aloha! My name is Kevin Nguyen and I was born and raised on Oahu. Coming into school I didn't know what to specifically major in business till I got a job at the IT Department at the Law School, one of my co-workers/friend whose currently graduating from MIS suggested that I should try out his major since it would help with the job while giving me a better understanding of technology. As I looked more into MIS it interested me more than the other majors since it combined the ideas of business and technology together so I decided to pursue it as a major.
