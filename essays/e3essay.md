The last WOD I did was Invoice1 where I had to create a sales receipt for a sale that contained five different products of my choosing, using expressions and variables to calculate the values dynamically. This WOD was a little struggle for me because there were little things that I kept missing and would slow my progress down since I would spend time figuring out what I missed. On my first try, I tried to figure things out on my own but realized that my progress was moving too slowly, I then tried to look up different things to use but they wouldn't work out for me, one thing that kept bugging me was why my document.write wasn't working out but I realied it was because I wasn't using a backtick which wasted a lot of my time since I kept getting furstrated. Before doing my second attempt I watched the screencast to see what the Professor had done and figured out how to things more efficently, after finishing the attempt and then watching it I realized I missed a bunch of things that needed to be changed (the quantity number in the extended price equation) so I had to redo it, this made me do the third one more cautiously. 

Comparing this WOD to the previous one's I've done I felt like this one was "simpler" because it was more of copy n pasting the same format for things instead of using different things like css and other stuff, but the code needed more attention since I had to change bits of it, and not changing that one bit would have a big impact on the final result. For the next WODS I'm going to take things slower so I don't make careless mistakes and redo the whole assigment. Overall this WOD was fun and it's very satisfying seeing things work out. One thing I'm gonna do differently to become more prepared on the next WOD is to review things to make sure I'm using the correct symbols when imputing the code.
