title: E3  WOD Technical Essay
date: 2020-0-26

The last WOD I did was Invoice1 where I had to create a sales receipt for a sale that contained five different products of my choosing, using expressions and variables to calculate the values dynamically. This WOD was a little struggle for me because there were little things that I kept missing and would slow my progress down since I would spend time figuring out what I missed. On my first try, I tried to figure things out on my own but realized that my progress was moving too slowly, I then tried to look up different things to use but they wouldn't work out for me, one thing that kept bugging me was why my document.write wasn't working out but I realied it was because I wasn't using a backtick which wasted a lot of my time since I kept getting furstrated. Before doing my second attemped I watched the screencast to see what the Professor had done and figured out how to things more efficently, after finishing the attempt and then watching it I realized I missed a bunch of things that needed to be changed (the quantity number in the extended price equation) so I had to redo it, this made me do the third one more cautiously. Comparing this WOD to the previous one's I've done I feel like this one was "simpler" because it was lot of copy n pasting the same format for things but it needed more attention since I had to change bits of it, and not changing that one bit would have a big impact on the final result. For the next WODS I'm going to take things slower so I don't make careless mistakes and redo the whole assigment. Overall this WOD was fun and it's very satisfying seeing things work out.
