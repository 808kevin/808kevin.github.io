My programming skills have improved since in the very beginning of the semester I had no idea how coding worked or even where to start with learning how to code, I will say that my understanding of coding is not the best but it's better than knowing nothing. I have the general idea of how coding works but I still need to learn the specifics of coding. What I need to work on to improve my programming skills is get a better understanding of the specific code I learn or be able to understand what a certain code does instead of doing trial and error with a bunch of code.

For the WODs I try to do them first without looking at the WODS but never fully able to figure them out so in the end I do end up looking at the screencast to figure everything out. The labs have helped me to learn and are a great resource to go back to get some references for future coding assignments but I do need a little help along the way to fully get an understanding of what is going on because I learn better when someone is demonstrating/explaining what is happening. I could also just test out the code myself too but it might take a little longer for me to understand it. I don't feel as ready to work on the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications like Assignment 1) because I can only do the basics, I feel like when it comes to the complex parts of programming for example the fine details of making a website look nice I need more practice. The class itself doesn't need any improvement in my opinion, Professor Port offers a lot of resources and assistance and considering how everything is online it makes it easier. The thing that work really well for my learning in this class are the various resources that are available at the ready along with all the examples provided by Professor Port.
