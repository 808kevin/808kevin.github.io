1.Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details

Assignment 2 is a continuation of assignment 1 with more requirements. The website required a login/registration page before being able to access the invoice page. In the login and registration page we had to have specific requirements like an amount of characters allowed for a password or only using lowercase, etc.

2.What did you learn from this assignment?

One thing I learned from this assignment that I found interesting was the login/registration part. The part where the data inputed for the login/registration that then goes through several guidelines to make sure everything is correct and then saving it was interesting. Outside of the requirements of the project I learned to take my time with things and if I got stuck on something I would take a small break to gather my thoughts instead of fustrating myself even more. Another thing I learned was to get help early.

3.Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).

The assignment was done individually but I did got a lot of help from a classmate and Professor Port.

4.How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?

When I needed help I asked a fellow classmate for suggestions in what to do or if they could check out my code to see what was wrong. I also went in for help with Professor Port when he offered 1 on 1 sessions. One thing I needed help with was missplaced code that I couldn't spot (having another person check out my code helped). I also needed help with some of the requirements like sticky values and getting alerts when something was wrong.

5.How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?

Devloping this assignment was different from assignment #2 since it had more requirements that had a lot of steps to included, and that everything that was added worked without distrupting the things done before in assignment #1.

6.Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging

My estimate of the time I spent on thinking about how to do something was maybe 60%, writing code took about 25% and testing and debugging took 15%.

7.Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?

What worked well on this product was having the products still being saved in the query string while in the login/registration page and then after going through those pages it was able to print out an invoice. Things that did not work well was having the data be sticky if something was wrong.

8.If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
If I could go back in time something I would do differently is get help earlier and to not get so fustrated if something doesn't work out.
